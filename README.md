# Portfolio

A short collection of my projects here on GitHub with summaries and easy access to the code samples

## Projects
### [Storm Chaser Car](https://github.com/Anduithe3rd/Storm-Chaser-Game)
- A work-in-progress unity game in which I developed my own Car Controller and Model for the car
- Skills - Unity, C#, Physics-based vehicle dynamics, 3D modeling

  - **[Car Controller Script](https://github.com/Anduithe3rd/Storm-Chaser-Game/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/NewDriving.cs)**: Handles the car's physics, suspension, acceleration, deceleration, and steering
  - **[Viewable Car Model](https://github.com/Anduithe3rd/Portfolio/blob/main/Folder/CarFinished.stl)**: Handmade and colored car model made in [Blender](https://github.com/Anduithe3rd/Portfolio/blob/main/Folder/Car2.blend)
 
### Cave Horror Game
- A work-in-progress unity game made with some friends
- Skills - Unity, C#, 3D Modeling
  - **[Character Controller Script](https://github.com/Anduithe3rd/Portfolio/blob/main/Folder/PlayerController.cs)**: Handles basic movement, collisions, and stamina (All of this was done by me aside from the crouch feature as well as some organization of the code)
  - **[Flashlight Script](https://github.com/Anduithe3rd/Portfolio/blob/main/Folder/Flashlight.cs)**: Simulates a crank flashlight, the player presses an assigned button to power the flashlight a certain amount (allowing them to press until it is at max output) as it constantly and slowly decreases its power until it turns off again. (All made by me)
  - **[Flashlight Model](https://github.com/Anduithe3rd/Portfolio/blob/main/Folder/CrankLight.stl)**: Work in progress (No Color, and not ready for animation) model of the crank flashlight made in [Blender](https://github.com/Anduithe3rd/Portfolio/blob/main/Folder/CrankLight.blend) (All made by me)
 
  ### [Python Blackjack](https://github.com/Anduithe3rd/Blackjack-Python-assignment)
